### Section 5: How to Shave with a Safety Razor (Technique Guide)
**Target Keywords:** how to use safety razor, safety razor technique, safety razor angle

**5.1 Before You Shave: Preparation**
- Shower first (warm water softens hair)
- Apply pre-shave oil (optional, helps sensitive skin)
- Use quality shaving soap/cream with brush (not canned foam)
- Build lather directly on face

**5.2 The Shaving Technique (Step-by-Step)**
1. **Load the blade:** Unscrew handle, place blade on baseplate, reassemble
2. **Hold at 30-degree angle:** Handle about 30° from face, let blade weight do work
3. **Zero pressure:** Only the weight of the razor—no pushing
4. **Short strokes:** 1-2 inch strokes, rinse blade frequently
5. **With the grain (WTG) first pass:** Map your beard grain direction
6. **Across the grain (XTG) optional second pass:** For closer shave
7. **Against the grain (ATG):** Only for experienced users, highest irritation risk

**Visual Diagram Needed:**
- Angle illustration (30° from face)
- Grain direction map (typical patterns)
- Pass direction arrows

**5.3 Common Mistakes to Avoid**
- Too much pressure (causes nicks and irritation)
- Wrong angle (blade won't cut or will scrape)
- Too many passes (1-2 is enough for most)
- Using dull blade (change at first sign of tugging)
- Shaving over un-lathered skin

**5.4 Post-Shave Care**
- Rinse with cold water (closes pores)
- Apply alum block (optional, antiseptic)
- Use alcohol-free aftershave balm
- Rinse and dry razor, store properly

### Section 8: FAQ Section (Schema Markup Ready)
**Target Keywords:** safety razor FAQ, safety razor questions

**Q1: Are safety razors better than cartridge razors?**
A: For most people, yes. Safety razors provide a closer shave with less irritation because they use a single sharp blade instead of multiple blades that tug and pull. They're also significantly cheaper long-term ($0.10-0.50 per blade vs $4-6 per cartridge) and better for the environment.

**Q2: How often should I change my safety razor blade?**
A: Most people change blades every 5-7 shaves, though this varies by beard thickness and blade brand. Signs you need a new blade: tugging sensation, requires more passes, or increased irritation. Some get 10+ shaves per blade; others prefer fresh blades every 2-3 shaves.

**Q3: Can beginners use safety razors?**
A: Absolutely. Modern safety razors like the Merkur 34C and Edwin Jagger DE89 are designed to be beginner-friendly. Expect a 2-4 week learning curve. Start with a mild razor and forgiving blade (like Astra SP or Derby Extra), use zero pressure, and maintain a 30-degree angle.

**Q4: Do safety razors cause less irritation?**
A: Generally yes. Single-blade razors don't create the "lift and cut" action of multi-blade cartridges that causes ingrown hairs. Combined with proper technique (no pressure, correct angle, quality lather), most users report significant reduction in razor burn and irritation.

**Q5: Are all safety razor blades the same size?**
A: Yes. Standard double-edge (DE) blades are universally sized and fit all standard safety razors. This means you can try any brand of blade in your razor. The only exception is proprietary systems like the OneBlade, which use their own blade format.

**Q6: Can I travel with a safety razor?**
A: Yes, with limitations. The razor handle can go in carry-on luggage—it's just metal with no blade. However, blades must go in checked luggage (TSA considers them prohibited items in carry-on). For short trips, some travelers buy blades at their destination.

**Q7: What angle should I hold a safety razor?**
A: Approximately 30 degrees from your face—imagine the handle pointing away from your face at a slight angle. A simple technique: place the razor head flat against your face (cap touching skin), then slowly tilt the handle down until the blade just begins to contact your skin.

**Q8: How do I avoid cuts with a safety razor?**
A: Three key factors: 1) Zero pressure—let the razor's weight do the work, 2) Proper angle—about 30 degrees, 3) Short strokes—1-2 inches at a time. Most cuts come from pressing too hard or trying to rush. Use quality lather and take your time, especially when learning.

**Q9: Are safety razors good for sensitive skin?**
A: Often better than cartridge razors. Single-blade design causes less irritation than multi-blade cartridges. For sensitive skin, choose a mild razor (Henson AL-13, Merkur 34C) with a gentle blade (Derby Extra), use pre-shave oil, quality lather, and follow up with alcohol-free aftershave balm.

**Q10: How much money can I save with a safety razor?**
A: Typical savings: $150-250 per year after the initial razor purchase. Example: Replacing $4.50 cartridges (4/month = $216/year) with $0.15 blades (4/month = $7.20/year) saves about $209/year. The $40 razor pays for itself in about 2-3 months.
